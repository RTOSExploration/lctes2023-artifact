# LCTES23-WIP: Towards Automated Identification of Layering Violations in Embedded Applications

## Getting Started Guide
contain instructions on how to set up (including, for example, a pointer to the VM player software, its version, and passwords if needed) and test your artifact. Anyone following this guide should be able to handle the rest of your artifact easily.


## Step-by-Step Instructions
Detail how your artifact can be evaluated. Include appropriate references to the relevant sections of your paper.

explain how to reproduce experiments or other activities supporting your paperâ€™s conclusions. Write this for readers who are deeply interested in your work and are studying to improve or compare against it. If your artifact runs for more than a few minutes, point this out and explain how to run it on smaller inputs.
